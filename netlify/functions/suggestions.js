// In our inline admin, window.mod exposes suggestAlternatives. In a function we mimic that:

export async function handler(event) {
  // Because our core is inline in index.html for the Admin, the function cannot import it directly.
  // For now, return a NOT IMPLEMENTED response explaining that the Admin inline core is separate.
  // If you want suggestions as a function, we need to move the core to /public/core.js again
  // and import from there (which we had earlier). Say the word and Iâ€™ll ship that refactor.
